## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I wanted to deviate from the figma design just slightly at the end of it to make it my own while also trying out new css properties like transform perspective and animation keyframes.
I initially started with css grid to align the card items but later changed it to flexbox instead to better match the original design.

### Continued development

I may want to do a version of this using css grid to get better practice with grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows.
